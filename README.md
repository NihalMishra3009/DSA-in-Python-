# DSA in Python

A structured repository for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms using Python**, built with a strong emphasis on **foundations, logical thinking, and step-by-step progression** before diving into core DSA topics.

This repository documents my learning journey transparently, focusing on **clean logic**, **disciplined practice**, and **correct time & space complexity intuition**.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### Phase 0: Foundations (Pre-DSA)
- Python programming fundamentals
- Conditional statements
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)
- Number and digit-based logic problems  
  - Reverse number  
  - Palindrome  
  - Prime number  
  - Armstrong number  
  - Fibonacci series  
- Functions and modular programming
- Basic recursion
- Introductory time & space complexity concepts
- Basic list handling (pre-array concepts)

> ⚠️ String-based shortcuts are intentionally avoided to build real DSA intuition.

---

### Upcoming (After Foundations)
- Arrays and array-based problem solving
- Searching and sorting fundamentals
- Further core data structures and algorithms

---

## 🎯 Learning Focus
- Foundations before advanced DSA
- Strong logical thinking
- Clean, readable, and well-commented code
- Step-by-step problem-solving approach
- Understanding *why* a solution works

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📌 Note
This repository serves as a **learning journal**, not merely a collection of solutions.  
Refactoring, mistakes, and incremental improvements are an essential part of the learning process and are intentionally preserved.
